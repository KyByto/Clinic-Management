üß™ Full-Stack Technical Assessment ‚Äì Senior Laravel & React Developer
Duration: 5 Days (05/06/2025 - 23:59 PM)
Goal: Evaluate practical skills in Laravel, Filament, React, API design, security, and architectural thinking.

üéØ Objective
Build a simplified Clinic Dashboard module for a startup SaaS platform.
The system should include two main parts:
Clinic Dashboard (Filament) ‚Äì for clinics to manage their offers.
Client Interface (React) ‚Äì for users to browse and book offers.

‚úÖ Assessment Requirements
1. Backend ‚Äì Laravel
Use Laravel 10+ and FilamentPHP for the admin/dashboard UI.
Implement authentication (basic email/password is fine).
Core models: Clinic, Offer, Client, Booking.
Features to implement:
Clinics can log in and manage their offers via Filament (CRUD).
API endpoints to:
List all offers
Create a booking (from client-side)
Simulate a payment integration (e.g., Stripe test environment or just payment intent logic).
Simulate messaging (e.g., Twilio, or Laravel Notification for SMS/email).




2. Frontend ‚Äì React
A minimal responsive app where:
Clients can browse offers (publicly)
Clients can submit a booking request for an offer
Focus on clean, basic UX (no need for polished UI, but clear functionality).

3. Security
Protect APIs (authentication + rate limiting + validation).
Sanitize user inputs and demonstrate awareness of common threats (XSS, CSRF, etc.).

4. Architecture Proposal (No Coding Required)
Submit a simple AWS architecture diagram (PDF or diagram tool export).
Must include:
MVP phase setup (minimal, low-cost)
Scaling phase suggestions (high traffic, data protection, backups, etc.)
Highlight services like EC2, RDS, S3, CloudFront, etc., and justify choices briefly.

üì¶ Deliverables
GitHub repo with clear commit history and structured folders:
/backend (Laravel + Filament)
/frontend (React client interface)
Architecture diagram for AWS infrastructure (MVP + scale phases)
Hosted demo (e.g., Vercel + Render/AWS/Heroku)

üîç Evaluation Criteria
Code quality and maintainability
Logical structuring of backend and API
Filament integration and usability
React implementation (simplicity, clarity)
Communication of architectural thinking
